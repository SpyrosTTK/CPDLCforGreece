# CPDLCforGreece

Welcome to my project!
I have created a profile ,based on the TopSky plugin for euroscope, to make use of the CPDLC & PDC features of the plugin!
The two files included in the package are mandatory in order to operate CPDLC & ACARS.
You can also add a file called TopSkyCPDLCsound.wav to get notified whenever a CPDLC or ACARS message comes through! (Bassicaly any sound you want below 1 second).
Finally, to operate CPDLC you should modify the Tags.txt or the Lists (Sector Exit or Inbound) and include the TopSky functions on top of the Euroscope ones.
I have included my own Tags.txt file! It is a modified version of the default KEPATH tag family!
