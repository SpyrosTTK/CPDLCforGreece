# CPDLCforGreece

Welcome to my project!
I have created a profile ,based on the TopSky plugin for euroscope, to make use of the CPDLC & PDC features of the plugin!

All six files included in the package are mandatory in order to operate CPDLC & ACARS. If you already have the Callsigns and Settings files, you should add the CPDLC files. Make sure that you have a Hoppie ACARS code from here >> https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/register.html

You can also add a file called TopSkyCPDLCsound.wav to get notified whenever a CPDLC or ACARS message comes through! (Bassically any sound you want below 1 second).

Finally, to operate CPDLC you should modify the Tags.txt or the Lists (Sector Exit or Inbound) and include the TopSky functions on top of the Euroscope ones.

I have included my own Tags.txt file! It is a modified version of the default KEPATH tag family!

You might want to take a quick look to a manual from VATSIMUK here >> https://community.vatsim.uk/topic/36405-full-cpdlc-guide-for-atc-area/

For those who do not currently have the TopSky plugin, I have included the latsest version. Expect frequent updates!

UPDATE!!! If you want to have bigger menus and staff, you can add this to the TopSkySettings.txt

//BEGIN SCALING (change values to your liking)

//Cursors (If you already have one pre-installed)

//System_GUI_Scale_Cursors=1

//Global Menu
System_GUI_Scale_GlobalMenu=1.4

//Radar Menu
System_GUI_Scale_Menus=1.3

//Route Vector
System_GUI_Scale_Screen=1

//Radar Targets
System_GUI_Scale_Tracks=1

//Normale Fenster
System_GUI_Scale_Windows=1.2

//END SCALING
